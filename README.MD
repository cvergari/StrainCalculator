# StrainCalculator

StrainCalculator calculates strains of a flat 2D regular grid 
undergoing a series of deformation steps, resulting in displacements of
the original grid. A typical application is the post-processing of
Digital Image Correlation (DIC) methods. In brief, a grid is somehow
applied to a sample, the sample is then loaded in a given number of
loading steps, and the position of each grid element is retrieved at
each step. An example of grid deformation:

## Context

Several toolboxes are available online for the processing of DIC data and calculation of strains. However, the strain calculation is often well hidden or not well documentent. The aim of this toolbox is to propose different methods to calculate strains, with clear documentation and examples.
This program is aimed at engineers, engineering students, but also researchers who use DIC and want to better control what is being calculated.



## Usage 

StrainCalculator() can use the displacements of the grid at each step
to compute a strain map.

```matlab

    obj = StrainCalculator();
    obj.generateFakeData('HorizontalCompression');
    obj.calculateStrains;
      
    for k = 1 : obj.nSteps
        cla
        obj.plotStrain(k);
        pause(0.3)
	end

```
	
Strains should be provided as an X and Y array of cells, each
containing the X and Y positions of the grid elements at each time
step.
