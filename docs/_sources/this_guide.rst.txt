About this guide 
=================

This guide is made with `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ . The sources of the guide are in `/docs_source`, but most of the contents of the guide are directly written within the Matlab code as docstrings.

When modifying the guide, for instance by changing the docstrings or the .rst files, it must be:

	- compiled
	- copied in the `/docs` folder

Sphinx can be installed in `conda <https://docs.conda.io>`_ , and it requires the additional package of `sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/matlabdomain>`_.
Once these packages are installed (optimally in a conda environment), the documentation can be compiled by typing `make html` in the docs_source folder. `make.bat` is a batch file that creates the HTML guide and copies the files. Use it as:

   make html
