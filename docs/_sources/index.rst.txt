StrainCalculator's documentation!
============================================

This is a toolbox to compute strain fields from a series of positions of a moving/straining grid. The typical application of this method is in the field of digital image correlation (DIC): a series of images are acquired of a sample being strained, so that each image represents a loading step. A grid is defined in the first image, and then all the elements of the grid are tracked, using DIC, in the following images.

The positions of each grid element at each loading step are the input. Displacement of the grid elements are calculated by the toolbox, and then strains.

Strain can be computed with the following methods:

  -  :meth:`Engineering strain <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainEng>`
  -  :meth:`Log strain <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainLog>`
  -  :meth:`Infinitesimal strain (todo) <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainInfinitesimal>`
  -  :meth:`Almansi strain <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainAlmansi>`
  -  :meth:`Green strain <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainGreen>`
  -  :meth:`True strain <StrainCalculator.StrainCalculator.StrainTrue>`
